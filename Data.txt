We want to sleep.
Some say love, it is a river 
  That drowns the tender reed.
  Some say love, it is a razor 
  That leaves your soul to bleed. 任由你的灵魂淌血 
  Some say love, it is a hunger 有人说，爱是那辘辘饥肠
  An endless, aching need. 一种无尽的带痛的需求 
  I say love it is a flower 我说，爱是一朵花 
  And you its only seed 而你，是唯一的种籽 
  It's the heart afraid of breaking" 怕摔怕受伤的心 
  That never learns to dance. 永远感受不到舞蹈的美 
  It's the dream afraid of waking" 怕好梦不长 
  That never takes the chance. 而让机会悄悄溜走 
  It's the one who won"t be taken 怕付出的心灵 
  Who cannot seem to give. 永远得不到收获 
  And the soul afraid of dying" 怕死亡的灵魂 
  That never learns to live. 永远无法明了生活的真谛 
  When the night has been too lonely 当夜显得寂寞不堪 
  And the road has been too long 去路变得无尽漫长 
  And you think that love is only 当你觉得只有幸运者 
  For the lucky and the strong 和强者才有幸得到爱... 
  Just remember in the winter 朋友，谨记，在严寒的冬日里 
  Far beneath the bitter snows 酷雪的覆盖下，躺着一颗种籽 
  Lies the seed that with the sun"s love 一旦春阳临照 
  In the spring becomes the rose. 就能幻化成一朵艳丽的玫瑰
Some say love, it is a river 有人说，爱是条河 
  That drowns the tender reed. 容易将柔弱的芦草淹没 
  Some say love, it is a razor 有人说，爱是把剃刀 
  That leaves your soul to bleed. 任由你的灵魂淌血 
  Some say love, it is a hunger 有人说，爱是那辘辘饥肠
